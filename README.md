OVERVIEW OF THE PROJECT:
PROJECT : NUMBERS GAME
OBJECTIVE : The objective of the **GuessTheNumberGame** Java program is to create an interactive console-based number guessing game that enhances a student’s understanding of basic programming concepts such as loops, conditionals, methods, user input handling, and random number generation. The game challenges the user to guess a randomly generated number within a specified range and a limited number of attempts, providing feedback on each guess. It also tracks the number of rounds played and won, encouraging logical thinking and improving user interaction skills through replay options and score tracking.
KEY FEATURES : 
    1.Random Number with Limited Attempts
        The game generates a random number between 1 and 100, and the user must guess it within a limited number of tries (e.g., 6),             encouraging logical thinking and decision-making.
    2.Real-Time Feedback & Input Validation
        After each guess, the program tells the user whether the guess is too high or too low, and safely handles invalid inputs (like           letters), making the game robust and user-friendly.
    3.Score Tracking & Replay Option
        The game tracks how many rounds the user has played and won, calculates the win rate, and allows multiple rounds — making it             feel more like a complete, interactive application.
TECHNOLOGIES USED : 
1.Java Language : Core programming language used to implement the game logic and structure.
2.Java Development Kit (JDK) : Required for compiling and running the Java program from the terminal or IDE.
3.java.util.Scanner & java.util.Random : (Scanner is used to take user input)(Random is used to generate the number to be guessed)
CONCLUSION ABOUT THIS PROJECT : The GuessTheNumberGame Java program is a simple yet engaging console-based application that helps beginners learn core programming concepts such as loops, conditionals, methods, user input, and random number generation. With its user-friendly interface, fun design elements like emojis, input validation, and score tracking features, the program goes beyond a basic guessing game to offer a complete learning experience. It effectively demonstrates how to build interactive applications in Java while encouraging logical thinking, problem-solving, and clean coding practices—making it an ideal mini-project for students and entry-level developers.
